# ( JQuery / Javascript ) Multi File Uploader
Droply is a responsive jQuery based plugin, that simplifies the developers task to setup a multi/single file uploader component. It is highly configurable and easy to install. This plugin comes with a configurable server side PHP script that should be clear enough for developers to customize. It is important to know that there is a list of permitted file (MIME) types, which can be configured conjuctively on both server/client side to filter out any type of harmful or undesired file types.

## (Contribution) Do you want to help improving this tool

Droply needs more developers to contribute to get the plugin to the next level. Please check the roadmap, and contact me if you are interested to be part of the team.

            allowedFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 10, 
            disableRemovingItems:true,          // Disable removing upload items from the list
            delay:5000,                         // Define a hide delay of each upload element if it is set to be hidden
            multi:true,                         // Enable multi-file select/upload
            dragDrop:true,
            theme: 'simplex',                   // You can select 3 different themes 'default', 'simplex' and 'super-simplex'
            url: "processMultipleUploads.php",  // URL on where the files should be submitted
            dataType: "json",                   // Define AJAX dataType

            label:'Allowed file types are gif, jpg, png, avi, mp3, wav, mp4, doc, docx, pdf, txt, zip and rar',
            labelColor:'rgb(90, 90, 90)',
            logoColor:'rgb(150, 155, 255)',     // Change the color of the logo
            textColor:'#DADADA',                // Change the color of border line and text
            borderColor:'#DADADA',
            disablePostProgressAnimation: false,
            progressBarColor: 'red',            // Change the color of the progress-bar {red, orange, and green}
            action:'itech_droply_submission',   // Pass a custom JSON object to the server side along the files
            successfulUpload: droply.successfulUpload,  // Event handler for successful file upload
            failedUpload: droply.failedUpload,          // Event for unsuccessful file upload
            fileDeleted: droply.fileDeleted             // Event triggers when file is deleted from the front-end
            dropBox:{
              title:'Drop files here', 
              height:100, 
              fontSize:26
            },
            required:"false", // Force the uploader to be required as a field inside a form
            stableUploadLbl: 'Everything going well so far!',
            deleteConfirmLbl:'Are you sure you want to delete the file?',
            maxUploadSize: 1024*1024*16,        // Define your server (max_post_size/upload_max_filesize), so the plugin can optimize chunk uploading process using this parameter
        });
````

This way you can initialize the plugin. Check the documentation and read more about options [options](http://www.itechflare.com/droply/docs/).

## Markup
This is the simple html markup.
````html
<div id="company-files"></div>
````

Even if you test all this in different browsers I recommend to add some kind of link to a basic uploader, this is still a new feature on several platforms.
